After going down many rabbit holes and research, I decided to build a 3D printer. There are vibrant communities which focus on printer builds of varying complexity and cost such those from Voron Design, RepRap, and HevORT. 

In evaluating and weighing options, I decided to build a Rook Mk2 printer fromÂ [Rolohaun Design](https://www.rolohaun3d.ca/). This was based upon the relative ease to build this printer compared to many others. Essentially it is beginner friendly.

This is the kickoff of my build updates to track my progress in building the Rook Mk2 printer. It is primarily helpful to me and may be of benefit to others exploring the world of 3D printing.

Here is a view of the Rook Mk2 printer.
